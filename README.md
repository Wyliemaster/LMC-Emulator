# LMC Emulator
An Interpreter for LittleManComputer that i wrote in a bit of free time

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+

## Notes

Probably awful, Python isn't one of my strongest languages. i know theres lots i could have probably done to improve but im satisfied currently

Was tested using the `sample.s` file. if you find any bugs be sure to create an issue
